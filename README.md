This is my practice related to AI & Computer Graphics. This repository is for educational purposes only. 

> Also I always wanted to make a tutorial/blog about computer graphics and hope this material will be complimentary for those who use slangpy.

## Usage

Requirements:
- Python >= 3.11

Follow these steps in following order:

1) git clone https://github.com/wh1t3lord/ai.git
2) pip install requirements.txt
3) now choose demo and run using main.py files that store in each top level subfolders (cg_raster; cg_rtx; cg_neural)

Or you can do this steps as in GIF:



## Overview

### Gaussian splatting
> This chapter contains different demos that are ordered 
1) Differentiable Rasterizer
